 Hi there! I'm Sila 👋

I am a 2nd-year Artificial Intelligence Operations student at Karadeniz Technical University (KTU).

My journey in AI began with a strong foundation in Software Development from Bornova Mesleki ve Teknik Anadolu Lisesi . During my high school education, I gained hands-on experience in a professional environment and honed my problem-solving skills during a long-term **IT Support** internship at **Provit IT**.

I further solidified my skills in database management and system design by developing a Personnel Tracking Automation project using `C#` and `MS SQL` during my first year at university.

My current goal is to leverage my background in software and IT operations, combined with my skills in `Python`, `Pandas`, and `SQL`, to contribute to the fields of Data Science and Machine Learning Operations (MLOps). 🚀

 🛠️ My Tech Stack

* Data Science & AI: `Python` | `Pandas` | `NumPy` | `Scikit-learn` | `Matplotlib`
* Database: `SQL` (MS SQL Server)
* Software Development: `C#`
* Fundamentals: `HTML/CSS`
